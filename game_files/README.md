***The game files (`main.py`, `set_difficulty.py` and `get_random.py`) will remain unpublished until the lessons are complete, so the "How to play" instructions will not work yet***

Congratulations on going through the full basics from 00 to 11  
The game design leverages on all you have learnt so far, while introducing the concept of numpy (a powerful tool to improve your computation significantly)  

As a refresher about how the game works, check the [pseudocode](pseudocode.md)

To also teach a bit of modularisation of the application, there is a split between how the game difficulty is computed, and how the random word is imported.  
You are, as always, welcome to improve on the code


## How to play
Change the directory to `game_files`
run `python main.py`
