# #HangMe
I am a bad guy, and I am to die by hanging, however, the only way to successfully hang me is to guess the word in my head,one letter at a time, in a specified number of tries.
- For each letter you guesss wrong, you slowly lose your change to get justice.
- For each letter you guess correctly, you gradually move towards your objective of hanging me

Can you successfully #hangme? 

## Difficulty level: Beginner

At the end of this #CodeAlong session, you should have been able to learn the following
- Basic Python syntax
- Variables
- Iterables
- Functions
- Conditionals and Loops
- Modules
- And some more advanced but simple-to-grab stuff

Ready to #CodeAlong? Let's begin! However, you need two tools to start
1. Git (You probably already have git, and a github account. If you don't, well, you can just hit "sign-up" now). Also download github by visiting https://desktop.github.com and following the instructions
2. Python. I normally recommend the full package of anaconda - a distribution that includes not only Python, but most likely everything you need to have as a Python Data Scientist

Once you have satisfied these requirements, you can start by:

1. Fork this git
2. Clone the fork on your PC
3. Join the live session, let us #CodeAlong
