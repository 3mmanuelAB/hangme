# How to run my code?


# OPTION 1 - Run as .py executable
#
#   Save your code with .py extension (e.g. _00_start.py)
#   Open command prompt
#   Navigate to the folder where the file is, usind cd (and dir or ls for Windows/Linux)
#   Run 'python yourfile.py' to execute the code in the file
#   Let's test by running this file, it should print "Y'ello Nigeria"
print("Y'ello Nigeria")

# OPTION 2 - Run from Python interpreter (or iPython notebook/interpreter)
#
#   Run Python - python
#   Other preferred options are:
#       ipython - a command line interactive python notebook with coloured coding (called linting)
#       jupyter notebook - an interactive web-based Python interpreter
#       jupyter lab - a full scale workspace-like notebook with file and folder management
#   Run the lines in the file one at a time
#   This method has become very common among data scientists because of its ease of debugging
